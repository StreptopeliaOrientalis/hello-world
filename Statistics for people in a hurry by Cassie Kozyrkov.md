### 1 What is statistics?

**statistic**: a summary measure computed from a sample (anyway of mushing up data).

**Statistics**: the science of changing your mind under uncertainty.

### 2 Different Schools

**Bayesian** statistics change their minds about beliefs.(incorperating data to update your beliefs) They like to report results using credible interbals.

**Frequentist** (classical) statistitics change their minds about acitons. You don't need to have a belief to have a default action, it's simply what you're committed to doing if you don't analyse any data.

### 3 Hypothesis 

Hypotheses are descriptions of what the world might look like.

**The Digestion of Statistics ==)Statistics**

Statistics digests your statistic into something that helps you take a reasonable course of action involving the population.

### 5 Convidence Interval

**parameter**: summary measure of a population

**statistics**: a summary measure computed from a sample

Let's make a reasonable decision based on partial information.

### 6 the math

If you don't have all the information, you can't know the answer. That's what it means to be uncertain.

### 7 Power Measures

**parameter**: the number we wish we knew for our decision. 

**hypothesis:** description of how the parameter might look

### 8 Errors

### 9 Don't answer the wrong question
